The repository contains python and jupiter notebook scripts to create inductance matrices via the partial inductance matrix. 
To use it, copy the template.txt to your folder and change the information as necessary. Then, copy either calculate_ind_matrix.ipynb 
or calculate_ind_matrix.py. Change the path and filename to match the txt file you just made from template. Then, run the code.

Notes:
In the template.txt, only change the bracketed values.
Example is given by files of the name example and folder example.
